"The organizations and committees at various levels (VDC, ADC, DEC etc) must ensure that climate change is integrated into their programmes, projects and plans.","Ma bungwe ndi ma komiti mu ma gawo onse (VDC, ADC, DEC mdi zina zotero) awonetsetse kuti kusintha kwa nyengo kukuyikidwa nawo mu ndondomeko, ma pulojekti ndi njira zawo zonse."
5.0 Implentation Plan,5.0 Njira yoyendetsera 
"5.1 Development of an Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy","5.1 Kupanga njira yoyendetsera, kuyang'anira ndi kuwunika ndondomeko"
"An Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy (IMES) has been developed as a complementary document to this Policy Framework to ensure that the NCCMP is effectively implemented.","Njira yoyendetsera, kuyanga'nira ndi kuwunika  (IMES) inapangidwa ngati chiphaso china cha padera ku ndondomeko iyiyi ndi cholinga chakuti NCCMP igwire ntchito. "
The IMES spells out the objectives and strategies that need to be implemented in order to address the climate related effects being faced by the country.,IMES imanena za zolinga ndi njira zimene zikufunika zipangidwe kuti dziko lithane ndi zotsatila zimene zikubwera chifukwa kusintha kwa nyengo.
The IMES further outlines the stakeholders that are relevant for implementation of specific strategies. ,Kuonjezera apo IMES imanena ma gulu okhudzidwa amene ali oyenera kuti agwire ntchito.
The strategies are in accordance with international best practice and are consistent with the UNFCCC and related agreements that Malawi subscribes to.,Njira zake zikuyenerezana ndi machitidwe abwino a zinthu a dziko lonse lapansi ndiponso ali ndende ndi migwirizano ya UNFCCC ndi ina imene Malawi inavomereza kuchita nawo. 
5.2 Incorporation of Climate Change into Sectoral and Partners’Strategic Plans,5.2 Kulowetsa kusintha kwa nyengo mu ndondomeko za ma gawo ndi abale ogwira nawo ntchito
"The structures established in the institutional framework will review and promote the incorporation of climate change into all relevant sectoral, ministerial and partner strategic plans.","Maziko amene akhazikitsidwa mu dongosolo la bungwe azawunika ndi kupititsa patsogolo kulowetsa nkhani za kusintha kwa nyengo mu ndondomeko za ma gawo, ma unduna ndi abale onse ogwira nawo ntchito. "
6.0 Monitoring and Evaluation,6.0 Kuyang’anira ndi kuwunika
"Climate change is a global, multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary issue. ","Kusintha kwa nyengo ndi nkhani yokhudza dziko lonse, kumakhudza ma gawo onse komanso ma gawo angapo a maphuziro"
"As a consequence, adaptation, as well as mitigation, technology transfer and capacity building requires intensive and continuous cooperation at local, regional, national and global levels.","Kutereku kuchepetsa komanso kuthuza, kuphunzitsa umisiri, komanso kupatsa anthu upangiri ndi kuphunzitsa anthu kumafunika mgwirizano wakathithi ndi opitilira mu ma gawo a mu dera, a fuko ndi dziko lonse la pansi. "
"Observing change, in ecosystems and livelihoods alike, can only be achieved by monitoring key indicators and communicating anomalies and trends to those who can take action.",Kuti tiwone kusintha kwabwino kwa zolengedwa zonse ndi miyoyo ya anthu tikuyenera kuyang’anira zizindikiro zofunika ndi kunena za zovuta zimene zikuwoneka kwa omwe angathe kuchita kanthu. 
"Government and its stakeholders are aware of the need to monitor and evaluate short term climate variability, long term climate change variables, and climate change related impacts.","Boma ndi okhudzidwa ake akudziwa za kufunika koyang’anira ndi kuwunikira za kusintha kwa nyengo zimene zimachitika mu kanthawi kochepa, zosinthika pa nkhani ya kusintha kwa nyengo za nthawi yaitali ndiponso zotsatila zobwera chifukwa cha kusintha kwa nyengo."
"This will allow evidence-based decisions to be made and to adjust the plans accordingly for effectiveness in adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer and capacity building measures.","Izi zithandiza kupanga ziganizo mogwiritsa ntchito umboni kuti ndondomeko ndipo kuti zinthu zisinthidwe malingana ndi ubwino wa kuchepetsa, kuthuza, kuphunzitsa umisiri ndi kulimbikitsa kuthekera kwa anthu. "
Monitoring and evaluation also provides a mechanism for institutional accountability.,Kuyang’anira ndi kuwunikira kumabweretsanso njira yokuti bungwe lidzikhala kuyankha kwa ena zimene akuchita.
"Progress with achievement of national developmental goals as outlined in the MGDS II, NAPAs, NAMAs, INDCs and NAPs can also be tracked through monitoring and evaluation","Kuyang’anira ndi kuwunikira kutha kuwonetsa ngati zolinga za chitukuko za dziko zomwe zinanenedwa mu MGDS II, NAPAs, NAMAs, INDCs and NAPs zikuyenda bwino."
"A detailed monitoring and evaluation plan has been developed with measureable, reportable and verifiable indicators to monitor and evaluate implementation of the NCCMP.","Ndondomeko ya tsatanetsatane yowunikira ndi kuyanga'nira yakonzedwa ndi njira zoyezera, zonenera kwa ena komanso zotsimizira kuti awone ndi kuwunikira kayendetsedwe ka NCCMP. "
This has been included as part of the IMES for this policy.,"A unduna wa zachilengedwa, mphamvu za magetsi and migodi ndi amene azakhale ndi udindo olumikiza za kuwona ndi kuwunikira za kayendetsedwa ka ndondomeko imeneyi."
"Other MDAs, NGOs, civil society, community based organizations and the private sector will also participate in monitoring and evaluation, ","Ma bungwe ena osakhala a boma, MDAs, ma bungwe owona za ufulu wa anthu, ma bungwe a anthu mma mdera, ma gawo osakhala a boma azatenga nawo mbali mu kuyang'anira ndi kuwinika.  "
thereby improving national data availability and accountability.,Akatero kupititsa patsogolo kapezedwe ndi katsimikizidwe ka nkhani iliyonse ya kusintha kwa nyengo. 
The NTCCC may receive reports from the monitoring and evaluation to better advise Government and its stakeholders on managing climate change.,NTCCC itha kuzalandira ma lipoti ochekera mu ma lipoti oyang'anira ndi akawuniwuni kuti athe kupereka uphungu ku Boma ndi ena onse okhudzidwa mu nkhani zoyendetsa kusintha kwa nyengo.
Regular review of progress in the implementation of the policy and advice on how to take the policy forward will be provided by the bodies established in the institutional framework.,Kawuniwuni wa kanthawi okhudzana ndi kayendetsedwa ka ndondomekoyi ndi malangizo a mmene ndondomekoyi ingayendere chitsogolo izaperekedwa ndi ma bungwe amene ali mu dongosolo la ma bungwe. 
A comprehensive review of the Policy is expected to be undertaken after five years of implementation.,Kawuniwuni wa tsatanetsatane wa ndondomeko azachitidwe zitatha dzaka zisanu zoyendetsa ndondomekoyi. 
"The National climate Change Management Policy seeks to guide programming of interventions for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, as well as adapting to the adverse effects of climate change and climate variability.",Ndondomeko yothandizira ntchito zothana ndi kusintha kwanyengo ikufuna kuthandizira ntchito zochepetsa kutulutsa mpweya womwe umawononga thambo loteteza ku dzuwa wa Greenhouse komanso kupeza njira zokhalira malingana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo. 
"The development of this policy is in tandem with national aspirations, as well as regional and international obligations.","Ndondomekoyi ikugwirizana ndi zokhumba za dziko lino, komanso ndondomeko zina za padziko lonse. "
"The policy will guide and coordinate implementation of relevant provisions enshrined in the United Nations Framenwork Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement at the national level.","Ndondomekoyi itsogolera ndi kuthandizira kukwanilitsa mfundo zomwe zili mu ndondomeko ya UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, ndi m’gwirizano waku Paris m’dziko muno."
The policy will be reviewed and updated every five years in order to incorporate emerging issues.,Ndondomekoyi idziwunikidwa ndi kukozedwanso pakatha zaka zisanu zilizonse kuti idzikhala yogwirizana ndi nyengo.
Malawi has taken significant strides towards addressing climate change.,Dziko la Malawi lapita chitsogolo pofuna kuthana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo.
"Through the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA), Malawi has identified sectors that are affected by climate change and these include agriculture, human health, energy, fisheries, wildlife, water, forestry and gender.","Kudzera mu ndondomeko ya National Adaptation of Programmes Action (NAPA), Malawi yapeza ma gawo ena antchito omwe akhudzidwa ndi kusintha kwanyengo, monga zaulimi, zaumoyo, za magetsi, usodzi, nyama zakutchire, madzi, zankhalango ndi zowona kuti pasakhale kusiyana pakati pa amuna ndi akazi. "
"Malawi has also prioritized climate change, environment and natural resources management among the priorities within priorities of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II).","Mu dongosolo la chitukuko la MGDSII, Malawi yayika patsogolo ntchito za kuthana ndi kusintha kwanyengo, chilengedwe ndi kusamalira zachilengedwe ngati zofunika kukozedwa msanga. "
The MGDS II recognizes that natural resources form a principal source of social well-being and economic development in Malawi and identifies the following issues that need urgent attention,Ndondomeko ya MGDSII imazindikira kuti zachilengedwe ndilo gwero la moyo wabwino ndi chitukuko m’Malawi ndipo inayika zinthu izi kuti zikozedwe mwachangu:
Climate variability,Kusinthasintha kwa nyengo
Inadequate institutional capacity for managing climate change,Kuchepekedwa kwa kuthekera kwa mabungwe kuthana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo
Inadequate mainstreaming of climate change issues,Kusaphatikiza ntchito za kusintha kwa nyengo mu ntchito zina
Inadequate enforcement of climate relevant legislation,Kuchepekedwa polimbikitsa kutsata malamulo okhudza za zanyengo
Increasing deforestation and unsustainable land use.,Kuwononga nkhalango ndi magwiritsidwe ntchito a malo mosayenera
Malawi has put in place a series of legislative sectoral frameworks and strategies to integrate environment and climate change management in socio-economic development activities,Dziko la Malawi layika malamulo ndi ndondomeko zosiyanasiyana pofuna kulowetsa za kusintha kwa nyengo mu ntchito za chitukuko
"Specifically, section 13 (d) describes the principles of national policy and provides that the environment principle is: ‘to manage the environment responsibly in order to prevent the degradation of the environment, provide a healthy living and working environment for the people of Malawi, accord full recognition to the rights of future generations by means of environmental protection, conserve and enhance the biological diversity of Malawi’","Makamaka gawo 13(d) ikulongosola za msanamila za ndondomeko ya dziko ndipo ikunena za msanamila ya ndondomeko ya zachilengedwe kuti ndi: “kusamalira za chilengedwe moyenera pofuna kupewa kuwononga za chilengedwe, popeleka umoyo wabwino ndi malo ogwirira ntchito abwino kwa aMalawi, kuzindikira ma ufulu a mibadwo yamtsogolo posamalira chilengedwe, kusamalira ndi kupititsa patsogolo zolengedwa zamoyo zosiyanasiyana za dziko la Malawi."
"This principle is consistent with Article 2 of the UNFCCC and is in tandem with the mandate of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining which is to protect and foster management, development and sustainable utilization of natural resources and environment","Msanamilayi ikugwirizana ndi gawo lachiwiri la UNFCCC ndipo ikugwirizana ndi udindo wa unduna wa Zachilengedwe, Zamagetsi ndi Zamigodi omwe ndi kuteteza, kupititsa patsogolo kusamalira ndi kugwiritsa ntchito zachilengedwe moyenera"
The Malawi Vision 2020 is the country’s overarching long term strategy that aspires for a technologically driven middle-income economy while providing an enabling framework for addressing climate change and other environmental challenges in a comprehensive manner,"Ndondomeko ya chitukuko ya Vision 2020 ndiye manthu wa ndondomeko zonse za dziko yomwe imalongosola za khumbo lokhala ndi dziko lotukuka pa chuma podzera mu ntchito za luso lamakono, komanso ikupereka njira zothandizira kuthana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo ndi mavuto ena a zachilengedwe.  "
"The NCCMP has also been informed by other relevant global, regional and national frameworks, plans, strategies, and conference outputs","Ndondomekoyi yakozedwanso potsatira ndondomeko, dongosolo, mapulani ndi mfundo za zokambirana zapadziko lonse, ndi mayiko a mudera lino"
"The Rio+20 global conference in 2012, under the theme “The Future we want”, focused on green economy as a tool for enhancing human well-being, social equity while contributing to better environmental management.","Msonkhano wa maiko onse wa Rio+20 womwe udachitika mchaka cha 2012 pa mutu oti “Tsogolo lomwe tikulifuna” unagwirizana za chuma chosawononga chilengedwe nde gwero la umoyo wabwino, kusasiyana pa zochita komanso kupititsa patsogolo ntchito za chilengedwe."
"Consequently, the NCCMP has incorporated aspects of green economy as a way of creating more jobs, involving the private sector and preserving environmental benefits by reducing carbon emissions and pollution.","Kotero, ndondomekoyi yayika ntchito zachuma zosamalira chilengedwe ngati njira zobweretsera ntchito zatsopano, mogwirizana ndi ntchito zamalonda ndi kusamalira phindu la zachilengedwe posatulutsa mpweya oyipa owononga chilengedwe"
The Policy also builds on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Environmental Action Plan which recognizes the importance of poverty reduction and socio-economic development in Africa,Ndondomekoyi ikugwirizananso ndi ndondomeko ya zachilengedwe ya NEPAD Environmental Action Plan yomwe imazindikira za kufunika kothetsa umphawi ndi kupititsa patsogolo chitukuko pa chuma mu Africa.
"With the sole exception of the NAPA, most of the national documents cited above, do not explicitly address action on climate change mitigation and adaptation","Kupatula NAPA, ndondomeko zomwe zakambidwa mmwambamu sizimalongosola mwa tsatanetsatane ntchito zathandiza kuchepetsa mavuto obwera ndi kusintha kwa nyengo ndi kusintha makhalidwe potengera nyengo"
"This being the case, activities related to climate change has operated within the context of general environmental management frameworks and they provide inadequate incentives and enforcement tools for climate change mitigation and adaptation","Pachifukwa chimemechi, ntchito zokhudza kusintha kwa nyengo zakhala zikugwiridwa pogwiritsa ntchito ndondomeko za ntchito zachilengedwe zomwe sizimapereka danga lokwanira ndi zida zoyenera kupitsa patsogolo kuchepetsa mavuto obwera chifukwa cha kusintha kwa nyengo komanso kuchita zinthu malingana ndi nyengo"
Malawi Government and its stakeholders realize that the nature of climate change impacts in the country necessitates a comprehensive climate change specific policy that recognizes the multiple dimensions and cross-cutting nature of climate change.,Boma la Malawi ndi mabungwe ena anazindikira kuti zotsatira za kusintha kwanyengo zinafunika kukhaka ndi ndondomeko yapadera yowona za kusintha kwa nyengo yomwe ikuzindikira kukhudzidwa ndi kusintha kwa nyengo kwa magawo asiyanasiyana.
"In Malawi, natural resources and the environment play a very significant role in influencing social and economic development at both household and national levels","Ku Malawi, zachilengedwe zimatenga gawo lalikulu kupititsa patsogolo chitukuko chapakhomo ndi cha dziko. "
"Approximately 80 percent of Malawians depend on renewable natural resources for livelihoods, and the foundation of the national economy is primarily rain-fed agriculture.","Pafupifupi aMalawi 80 pa 100 aliwonse amadalira zachilengedwe zam’bwezera pa moyo wawo wa tsiku ndi tsiku, komanso tsinde la chuma cha dziko ndi ulimi wodalira mvula"
"The success of many important sectors of the economy such as agriculture, water supply and sanitation, transport, tourism, industry, health and education relies on environment and natural resources to enhance their productivity.","Kuchita bwino kwa magawo osiyanasiyana a chuma monga ulimi, zamadzi ndi ukhondo, za mtengatenga, zokopa alendo, zamakampani, umoyo ndi maphunziro zimadalira chilengedwe ndi zachilengedwe kuti zipite patsogolo"
"However, environmental degradation and climate change have emerged as major development issues that have adversely impacted on food security, water quality and energy security, thereby frustrating government efforts to improve the general livelihoods of both urban and rural communities","Koma kuwonongeka kwa chilengedwe ndi kusintha kwa nyengo zapezeka kuti ndi zomwe zasokoneza zokolola, ubwino wa madzi ndi zamagetsi, kotero kusokoneza ntchito za boma kutukula umoyo wa anthu a mtauni ndi kumudzi"
"Scientific evidence in Malawi shows an increase in frequency, intensity and magnitude over the last two decades of extreme weather events.","Umboni wa sayasi ku Malawi ukusonyeza kukwera, kuchitika pafupipafupi, ndi kuchuluka kwa kutentha ndi zochitika zobwera chifukwa cha kusintha kwa nyengo. "
"These events include prolonged dry spells, seasonal droughts, intense rainfall, riverine floods and flash floods","Mavuto a zanyengo ndi monga chilala, mvula yochuluka kwambiri, kusefukira kwa mitsinje ndi madzi osefukira"
"Using the results from formal economic models, if Malawi does not act now, the direct overall costs due to climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year.","Pogwiritsa ntchito zotsatira za kafukufuku wazachuma, ngati dziko la Malawi silichitapo kanthu panopa, zomwe dziko lingaluze chifukwa cha kusintha kwa nyengo ndi chimodzimodzi zosachepera 5 kwacha pa 100 kwacha iliyonse ya chuma cha dziko lonse chaka chilichonse"
"On average, USD 12.5 million (MK8.9 billion) or 1% of the GDP and USD 9 million (MK6.4 billion) or 0.7% of the GDP is the annual cost of addressing droughts and floods respectively at the current exchange rate",Pafupifupi 12.5 million zakwa America (MK8.9 billion) kapena gawo limodzi la chuma chonse cha dziko (GDP) ndi 9 miliyoni yakwa America (MK6.4 biliyoni) kapena theka la gawo limodzi la GDP ndi ndalama zomwe zimagwiritsidwa ntchito pothandizira pakagwa chilala ndi kusefukira kwa madzi.
"Taken together, the direct cost of droughts and floods is about 1.7% of Malawi’s GDP every year","Kuphatikiza zonse, ndalama zomwe zimagwira ntchito yothana ndi kusefukira kwa madzi ndi chilala ndi pafupifupi 1.7 ya chuma chonse cha Malawi"
"Overall, agriculture suffers the greatest losses and the ensuing food shortages cause domestic grain prices to rise while grain imports increase rapidly to cover the gap thereby eroding the foreign exchange reserves with depreciating effects on the exchange rate","Pazonse, ulimi ndiwomwe umavutika kwambiri ndipo kusowa kwa zakudya imapangitsa mitengo ya chimanga kukwera kwambiri pamene dziko limayamba kugula chimanga kunja kufuna kuthetsa njala nthawi yomweyo kuwononga ndalama zakunja"
"Consequently, the food shortages elicit demand for resource reallocation to food security response at the expense of other productive sectors.","Zotsatira zake, kusowa kwa chakudya kumapangitsa kuti ndalama zambiri zipite kogulira zakudya kupangitsa magawo ena a chitukuko kuvutika"
"The prices of other food stuffs also increase, fuelling inflation with knock-on effects on interest rates, macroeconomic outlook, and distorting the business environment.","Mitengo ya zakudya zina imakweranso, kupangitsa kuti mphavu ya ndalama itsike ndi kusokoneza ntchito zamalonda"
"Climate shocks therefore have a potentially profound direct effect on the agriculture sector, while indirectly affecting other economic sectors and non-farm households through price and production linkages.","Zovuta zobwera chifukwa cha kusintha kwa nyengo zili ndi kuthekera kwakukulu kosokoneza ntchito za ulimi, komanso kusokoneza magawo ena a zachuma kudzera kukwera kwa mitengo ndi kusokonezeka kokoza katundu."
Government of Malawi has developed a NCCMP to assist the country achieve its long-term goal for climate change management which is to reduce the socioeconomic impacts of adverse effects of climatic change,Boma la Malawi lakonza ndondomeko ya NCCMP kuti ithandize dziko la Malawi kukwaniritsa cholinga chachikulu chochepetsa mabvuto obwera kamba ka kusintha kwa nyengo
The medium term outcome is improved community resilience to climate change through the development of sustainable livelihoods and reduced emissions of GHGs,Cholinga cha pafupi ndi chokweza miyoyo ya anthu kudzera mu kutukula miyoyo yawo ndi kuchepetsa mipweya yoonjezera kutentha mlengalenga (GHGs).
"Therefore, the Policy will act as a mechanism for harmonizing and enhancing the planning, development, coordination, financing and monitoring of climate change initiatives and programmes in Malawi.","Choncho, ndondomekoyi ikhala yolunzanitsa ndi kuongolera ntchito yokonzekera, kulongosola, kuyendetsa ndi kuyang’anira ntchito yolimbana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo ku Malawi."
"The Policy articulates the goals and objectives for climate change management in Malawi, as well as principles and strategies to guide implementation of activities aimed at reducing socio-economic impacts of adverse effects of climate change.","Ndondomekoyi ikufotokozera zolinga, zotsatira komanso mfundo ndi njira zotsogolera ntchito yolimbana ndi mabvuto a kusintha kwa nyengo."
"The Policy guides implementation of critical climate change issues and strategies, including capacity building; education, training and public awareness; the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+); adaptation and mitigation in Agriculture, Energy, Industrial processes, Waste management, Forestry, Water resources, and Wildlife sectors.","Ndondomekoyi ikutsogolera ntchito zikuluzikulu zoti zitsatidwe polimbana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo monga kuonjezera kuthekera; kuphunzitsa ndi kudziwitsa; kugwiritsa ntchito njira za chitukuko zosaononga chilengedwe (CDM); kusamala nkhalango kuti tichepetse mipweya yoonjezera kutentha mlengalenga (REDD+); kuchepetsa mavuto mu magawo a ulimi, mphamvu, ma fakitale, kasamalidwe ka zinyalala, za nkhalango komanso nyama za kutchire"
"In particular, the Policy will build on the National Environmental Policy (NEP) that deals with issues of air quality, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and supplement several guiding principles.","Ndondomekoyi ikuonjezera pa ndondomeko ya kasamalidwe ka chilengedwe (NEP) yomwe imayang’ana za mpweya, kuchepetsa mipweya yoonjezera kutentha mu mlengalenga ndi kuonjezera pa mfundo zina zotsogolera. "
"Recognizing the multiple dimensions and cross-cutting nature of climate change and the diversity in roles played by the various actors in climate change management, the NCCMP will compliment other relevant policies such as those of energy, water, agriculture and forestry.","Pozindikira kuti nkhani ya kusintha kwa nyengo ikukhudza ma gawo osiyanasiyana komanso mbali zosiyanasiyana zimene ma gawo ena amatengapo polimbana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo, ndondomekoyi idzagwiritsidwa ntchito mothandizana ndi ndondomeko zina zogwirizana monga za mphamvu, madzi, ulimi ndi nkhalango."
The Policy specifies strategies for each sector under the broader themes of climate change adaptation and mitigation,Ndondomekoyi ikusanthula njira zomwe zingatsatidwe ndi magawo ena polimbana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo ndi zotsatira zake.
"The NCCMP will serve as an overarching reference document for policy makers in Government, the private sector, civil society, and donors concerning climate change as a priority development issue","Ndondomekoyi idzakhala yoongolera ntchito za boma, ma kampani, mabungwe omwe si aboma, ndi mayiko othandiza dziko lino pa nkhani ya kusitha kwa nyengo"
"It does not usurp powers and responsibilities of sectoral ministries, but instead reinforces them and highlights areas of high priority for the nation",Ndondomekoyi siikulanda mphamvu kapena udindo wa maunduna ena koma ikulimbikitsa mbali yofunikira pa chitukuko cha dziko
"The Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining will play a facilitating, coordinating and advisory role in ensuring its implementation, setting and enforcement of relevant and acceptable standards.","Unduna wa Zachilengedwe, Mphamvu zamagetsi ndi Migodi udzatenga gawo lolunzanitsa ndi kulangiza kuti ndondomekoyi itsatidwe ndi kugwiritsidwa ntchito moyenelera. "
The NCCMP objectives should be seen as addressing the broad range of climate change problems facing Malawi at the present time and the projected future impacts.,Ndondomekoyi yakonzedwa kuti ikonze mavuto amene dziko la Malawi likukumana nawo pakali pano ndi mtsogolo chifukwa cha kusintha kwa nyengo.
"As such, the Policy is intended to address a number of challenges that have hitherto hindered effective implementation of climate change actions in the country.","Choncho, ndondomekoyi yabwera kudzachotsa zimene zimalepheretsa ntchito yolimbana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo m’dziko muno"
These include inadequate financing towards climate change programmes and interventions from domestic budgetary allocations; and weak enforcement to minimize causes of climate change,Izi ndi monga kuchepa kwa ndalama zogwilira ntchito yolimbana ndi kusintha kwa nyengo mu ndondomeko ya chuma ya dziko lino; komanso kufooka kwa ntchito yolimbana ndi zimene zikukulitsa vuto la kusintha kwa nyengo
Aiming to avert large-scale flood and drought damage in Malawi,"Ndi cholinga chofuna kupewa mavuto aakulu a kusefukira kwa madzi ndi chilala m’Malawi,"
